# 📢About

Brainstorming meals can be challenging on some day. With the recipe website, not only you have access to multiple dishes from different cuisines, but you can also search meals based on what you're craving for that day 😋. 

For example, you're looking for some cookies recipe, simply input 'cookies' into the search bar. By using API from [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api), all of the available cookies recipes will be pulled and presented to you 🍪🙌🏻.
